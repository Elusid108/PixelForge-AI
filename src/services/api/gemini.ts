1. ${focusInstruction} Never repeat a theme twice in a row.
2. **The Tone:** Write like a master poet. Use sensory language, metaphor, and emotive adjectives. Focus deeply on lighting, texture, atmosphere, and the "feeling" of the scene.
3. **The Constraint:** Describe **ONLY** the visual reality within the scene. Do NOT describe the artistic medium or rendering style.
    * *BAD:* "A photorealistic oil painting of a cat."
    * *GOOD:* "A feline silhouette bathed in amber dusk, its fur a rugged landscape of shadow and gold."
4. **Length:** Write a **minimum of 3 sentences**. Aim for a lush, detailed paragraph. Do not be brief.

**Output:** Just the description. Nothing else.`;
